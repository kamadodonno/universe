      how u doing kani, hope u doing well. 
      thanks for visiting this website again... if you're reading this that means you may have thought of me and you still think about me sometimes. I'm glad you do, i too miss you and think of you. everything that has happened is not something i'm proud of... but all i can hope for is that u don't hate me, i remember u once said you can never hate someone you once liked or loved i hope that same goes for me too because i believe i was or am one of them atleast until i fucked up....
    </p>

    <p>
    I'm not gonna justify any of the thing that i did, anything that happened has happened and the damage is done and now we're again separated and this time for a very long time ig if not forever, i think we're like parallel lines... We are forever run parallel to eachother, never intersecting no matter how infinite or eternal our existence may be. can't blame the universe tho.. I'm the one to blame.. only fucking things up and i don't want to waste our time by keep saying sorry every now and then in this page so I'll just keep all this short and say it once I'm sorry kanika, I'm sorry for everything i did wrong and for everytime i hurt u, cuz ik i did that too many times now, u genuinely wanted to give me chance and u did gave me opportunies but i didn't have patience, i tried to understand you i mostly did but recently i kind of was not understanding you that well, i wish i was not in that bad mood and i had not taken that pedo thing to my heart... well but what could i do someone else telling this to you is okay but than it makes you think something and that too YEAH... MAYBE.... but yeah i should just work on my tempor , it might be for the best that i got away so u won't make any wrong mistakes, cuz if u had chosen me u would have regretted later..
    </p>

    <p>
    no u wouldn't have i will not do anything in relationship to make u regret so nah you wouldn't have regretted it but nvm. i really hope this is not a cannon event and in some other universes we are together...
    </p>

    <p>
      as you already know i really really like u and always will altho my actions don't really justify that but yeah i do but i wish there was any future of us where we're together well it was quite possible but me 😛 
    </p>

    <p>
      and yeah u too once have said that u have tried many times but u can't imagine us together. maybe you were right but who knows.. maybe not but not that it matters now, just so u know I'll always remember u I'll always cherish the time we had together I'll always like u just the way i did and do, u can text me whenever u need me or u need any help or anything like that even if it's just a brief talk and so will i do. i hope u have a very happy life ahead. i hope everything u wish for comes true and u never have to adjust for anything or settle for anything less. btw i didn't get to hear your dream that day i wish mauka dekh ke wapis puch liya hota but nvm it's too late ig, I'll have to get busy now otherwise ill keep thinking about you and will be sad all time and regret it, if i make myself busy i hope i wont think much about it but who am i kidding thats not gonna happen im gonna miss you regardless but i can try atleast I'll try to change my life i don't have much to do anyways it's mostly goal less and ik u don't like that kind of people but I'm that kind of person what can i do.
    </p>

      People do say that people can change with time but all their build up personality from very childhood is very hard to change. most of things i do is reflection of my childhood be it bad or good and i don't blame it tbh i like the kind of person i am if i just leave some not so good things about me aside.. but now I'll just do whatever feels right.. for now i feel like travelling and exploring places. i just don't wanna stick to a place or to any person anymore I don't feel like i belong somewhere in perticular, I'll try to convince my parents to let me go explore.. for now they wont allow me to go someway far away ill discuss this mostly next month hope they agree with me which they definitely won't but let's see.... 
    </p>

    <p>
      btw i saw sunset today, the sky was all orange it was beautiful they always are... haina? you may also have seen many or few sunsets
      well the sunset is beautiful isn't it?
    </p>

    <p>
       well i have many things to say but I'll keep it short and end it here
