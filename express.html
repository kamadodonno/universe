      how u doing kani,hope u doing well. well thanks for visiting this website again, this means you still think about me. I'm glad you do, i just hope u don't hate me, i remember u once said you can never hate someone you once liked or loved i hope that's same goes for me too because i believe i was or am one of them atleast until i fucked up....
    </p>

    <p>
    I'm not gonna justify any of the things i did, anything that happened has happened the damage is done and now we're again separated and this time for a very long time ig, i think we're parallel lines... We are forever destined to run parallel, never intersecting no matter how infinite or eternal our existence may be. can't blame the universe tho.. I'm the one to blame.. only fucking things up and i don't want this page to be my sorry page so I'll say it just keep all this short and say it once I'm sorry kanika for everything i did and for everytime i hurt u, cuz ik i did it too many times now, u genuinely wanted to give me chance but i didn't have patience, it actually is good that i got away so u don't make wrong mistakes, cuz if u had chosen me u would have regretted later..
no u wouldn't have i might not do anything in relationship to make u regret so nah you wouldn't have regretted it but nvm
    </p>

    <p>
      as you already know that i like u and always will altho my actions don't really justify that but yeah i do but i wish there was a bright future ahead of us where we're together well it was quite possible but me üòõ 
and yeah u too once have said that u have tried many times but u can't imagine us together. maybe you were right who knows.. maybe not but not that it matters now, just so u know I'll always remember u I'll always cherish the time we had together I'll always like u just the way i did, u can text me whenever u need me or u need any help or anything like that even if it's just a brief talk and so will i. i hope u have a very happy life ahead. i hope everything u wish for comes true and u never have to adjust for anything or settle for anything less. btw i didn't get to hear your dream that day i wish mauka dekh ke wapis puch liya hota but nvm it's too late ig, I'll try to change my life i don't have much to do anyways it's mostly goal less and ik u don't like that kind of people but I'm that kind of person what can i do.
People do say that people can change with time but all their build up personality from very childhood is very hard to change. most of things i do is reflection of my childhood be it bad or good and i don't blame it tbh i like the kind of person i am if i just leave some not so good things about me aside.. but now I'll just do whatever feels right.. for now i feel like travelling. i just don't wanna stick to a place or to any person anymore I don't feel like i belong somewhere in perticular, I'll try to convince my parents to let me go explore.. mostly next month hope they agree with me which they definitely won't but let's see.... 
btw i saw sunset today, the sky was all orange it was beautiful they always are... haina?
   well the sunset is beautiful isn't it?
    </p>

    <p>
       well i have many things to say but I'll keep it short and end it here
    </p>

    <p>
      Goodbye Kanika üíó
