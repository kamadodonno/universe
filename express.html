      how u doing kani, well thanks for visiting this website again, this means you still think about me. I'm glad you do, i just hope u don't hate me, i remember u once said you can never hate someone you once liked i hope that's same goes for me too....
    </p>

    <p>
    I'm not gonna justify any of the things i did or u did, anything that happened has happened the damage is done and now we're again separated, i think we're parallel lines... We are forever destined to run parallel, never intersecting no matter how infinite or eternal our existence may be. can't blame the universe tho.. I'm the one only fucking up and i don't want this page to be my sorry page so I'll say it just once I'm sorry kanika for everything i did and for everytime i hurt u, and ik i did it too many times, u genuinely wanted to give me chance but i didn't have patience, it actually is good that i got away so u don't make wrong mistakes, cuz if u had chosen me u would have regretted later..
no u wouldn't have i might not do anything in relationship to make u regret so nah you wouldn't have regretted it but nvm
    </p>

    <p>
      i hope you already know that i like u and always will but there is no future together for us, not that i can see it and u too once have said that u have tried many times u can't imagine us together. I'll always remember u I'll always cherish the time we had together, u too can text me whenever u need me and so will i. i hope u have a very happy life ahead. i hope everything u wish for comes true and u never have to adjust for anything or settle for less. btw i didn't get to hear your dream that day i wish sun liya hota but nvm it's too late ig 
    </p>

    <p>
      i have many things to say but I'll keep it short and end it here
    </p>
    <p>
      Goodbye Kanika üíó
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours only
      Mehul Nikam
