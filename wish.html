    <h1>🌸 For you 🌸</h1>

Hey Kanika, happiest birthday to you.  
Many many happy returns of the day.  

I just wanna tell you that I'm really happy to have you in my life,  
and I just am too grateful that I have you again — and this time a bit longer,  
and I hope much much longer or forever if possible. 

Today u said I was just quiet on call. I was actually working on this.  
Not like I always talk much on call, but today I was just too extra quiet.  
I was thinking about what to do on this thing here so that you would like it.  
Hope you like this. There were too many things I still need to do.  
I didn't get much time to complete all this.  
Before I was doing thoda bahot kaam on this, and today too I was so busy that I couldn't do much.  
Still, I hope you like this.  

This is just a very little of feelings expressed here,  
but there are a lot more inside my heart.  

Well, you mean too much to me.  
You said God and universe doesn't like you — well I do. 
you're the one because of whom i started believing in god afterall 
And *** **, *** *** ** *** *** ** ********. 

Too big thing to say but I feel it and mean it.  
Everything nowadays is about you. Every thought and every moment is about you.  
I just want to see you, listen to you, and sit beside you,  
have our special moments,  
have some moments — hugs, kisses, cuddles, little bit of pitai from you — that's the dream.  

You asked me about one moment when I realized that you are the one.  
I didn't actually have had that moment till now yet — but in future maybe.  

Here I could have mentioned me crying for you,  
but ek incident ko baar baar nahi nichodunga to prove a point that I like you.  
That's why I need to make new memories.  

And I want to be better at everything,  
so you can be sure that you don't need to have these isolations and avoidant attachment type shit.  
And you can fully trust me and be the baddie with no depressive issues.  
You may say that these things never change,  
but I'm still gonna try.  

I really fw this line —  
"**Tum haar ke dil apna meri jeet amar kardo**"  
So I'll have to make you lose your heart to me, or in other words, win your heart over.  

I am ready to do everything it takes to be the perfect one for you.  
Because you know *mard jaat sabhi bhadwe hai*,  
so train this one *bhadwa*, or let this *bhadwa* try to be an actual man —  
the one you can trust with your eyes closed and feel safe around.  

I hope you stay happy, healthy, and successful,  
and you achieve everything you ever wanted and ever will.  

I have too many things to write,  
but I just don't have any time for now,  
so I'll just cut this short —  
**Happy birthday, my little angel (not angle).**  

**HAPPY BIRTHDAY KANIKA**  
**MAY THIS AND EVERY OTHER YEAR BE FILLED WITH JOY AND HAPPINESS FOR YOU.**
