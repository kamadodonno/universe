        <h2>16 May 2024</h2>
        <p>We met through an Instagram group chat recovery mission. You were the only one who came online to help â€” and you did.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="event">
        <h2>22 May 2024 - 22:22</h2>
        <p>We started talking in DMs. The bond started to form.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="event">
        <h2>31 May 2024 - 00:00</h2>
        <p>Our last short convo before silence â€” I was left on seen.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="event">
        <h2>9 Aug 2024</h2>
        <p>You came back. We talked, cleared things up, but something had changed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="event">
        <h2>1 Sep 2024 - 13:13</h2>
        <p>We said goodbye. I let you goâ€¦ again.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="event">
        <h2>4 May 2025 - 23:10</h2>
        <p>You texted me the night before your NEET exam. You wanted to talk.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="event">
        <h2>6 May 2025</h2>
        <p>I took the day off work to talk with you. We said everything we had to. You made me smile again.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="event">
        <h2>17 May 2025 - 00:20</h2>
        <p>You wanted to disappear againâ€¦ but you came back the same day at 14:19.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="event">
        <h2>26 May 2025</h2>
        <p>You tried to leave again â€” this time not because you didnâ€™t care, but because you did. And yet, you're still here.</p>
