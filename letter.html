    <h1>Dear Kanika,</h1>
    <p>
      aaj bhi i remember that day backchodi chal rahi thi bc. gc heist chal raha tha who could possilbly think ki aisa ho sakta hai,
      nigga told me to add chicks and i somehow added this fine shwty in first go. the first one i added and the only one who came online.
      than that all sorted out and we were in backyard basement 2.0 ..
    </p>

      aise to it's been 1 year  but aise its not even been 2 months, we started with flirt.
      it was good for few days thn things happened and me being impatient child i was not as bright as I'm today (u may say I'm still dumb but atleast not as much as before) 
    at that time. U left it wasn't much days but i did keep thinking about u for sometime and in the end i 
    convinced myself that it was gonna end it if not today thn tomorrow if she was gonna go and maybe 7 din me uska intrest chala gaya hoga cuz thats how todays generation is.
     Later on aug 9 she texted and i was kind of happy kind of shocked i did think what should 
    i do i decided to talk and I'm really grateful that i choose that option. This time i got to know u altho the 
    thing we had- how we were before this was different before it was all flirt mostly. This time we talked more i 
    got to know u- about u- your past as well as your present
    </p>

    <p>
    I got to know u bit more if not all and idk what i loved about u but i just did, i had feelings for u in 
    less thn a month of time anyone would think that was just attraction even i do think that now but it was 
    more than that ig even i can't tell that surely. I was seeing this new u- I've never seen anyone like this, 
    pushing people away by being rude to not hurt them is crazy, but crazy how now i liked this crazy person and still do. 
    After so many tries to stay with you i finally gave up on exact 13:13 on sep 1 (pahele 00:00 ab 13:13 😭🙏🏿). 
    </p>

    <p>
    After this happening i saw no possibility of us talking back together ever again, but it fucking happened on 4 April 
    the date which i waited for so long. I was shocked happy afraid all at once. It was emotional cocktail. And here we 
    are we did have some ups and down in these 24 days but atleast we still are together in touch and that's all I'm thankful 
    for i just think that if u stick along we can work this out even if it doesn't than these will be my one of the most if not 
    most memorable moments of my life

      You’ve made me smile, made me wait, made me wonder, made me question myself, made me want to be better and yes, even cry.  
      But above all, you made me feel. And that in this ever-rushing world,  
      is something rare. I don't know where this road leads.  
      I don’t even know where we’ll be tomorrow.  
      But I do know that I cherish this journey — with all its mess and magic —  
      because you’re in it.
      and i hope that we’ll work things out if we try enough and i alone can also try and make things work out but for that just let me stay.
      you’re everything i've got and everything i ever wanted
    </p>

      You call it complicated, I call it real.  
      And real is always a little messy, a little raw,  
      but also — beautifully unforgettable.
